# APS360 Applied Fundamentals of Deep Learning

## Course Description
APS360 is an immersive course designed to impart practical skills in deep learning. It equips students with the know-how to build and train neural networks for a variety of tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing.

## Labs Overview

In this repository, you'll find a series of labs that progressively build your understanding and expertise in deep learning applications:

### Lab 1: PyTorch and ANNs (`lab1_pytorch_and_anns.py`)
Introduction to PyTorch and implementation of basic Artificial Neural Networks for regression.

### Lab 2: Image Classification (`lab2_cats_vs_dogs.py`)
Dive into Convolutional Neural Networks to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

### Lab 3: Gesture Recognition (`lab3_gesture_recognition.py`)
Utilize CNNs to classify images based on hand gestures, exploring the power of visual pattern recognition.

### Lab 4: Data Imputation (`lab4_data_imputation.py`)
Discover autoencoders and their ability to perform data imputation, filling in missing information in datasets.

### Lab 5: Spam Detection (`lab5_spam_detection.py`)
Delve into Recurrent Neural Networks to classify sequences of text and detect spam messages.
